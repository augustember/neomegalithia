<h1 id="actions">Actions</h1>


<p>
Actions are things your character does. And in the world of Megalithia, your character can do a lot. 
</p>
<h2>Actions Per Round</h2>


<p>
During fast times, you are allowed a certain number of different action types per round. You start with 2 standard actions and 1 extra action per round of fast times. This may be increased upon gaining certain levels or taking certain traits.
</p>
<h2>Standard Actions</h2>


<p>
Standard actions are an action type which take a bit more focus to use. These are most skills, abilities, and increments of your movement speed. 
</p>



<p>Examples of standard actions include but are not limited to:</p>
<li>A skill check</li>
<li>An attack ability</li>
<li>Most abilities</li>

<h2>Extra Actions</h2>

<p>
Extra actions are actions which can be done briefly and don’t require as much focus. 
</p>



<p>Some examples of extra actions include:</p>
<li>Giving a verbal command to an ally</li>
<li>Switching out a piece of equipment</li>
<li>Using a single-use item</li>
<li>Throwing an item to an ally</li>
<li>Interacting with an object</li>
<li>Readying your Weapon</li>
<li>Certain abilities</li>


<p>
Most of your skills and abilities use up 1 of your standard actions for your action allowance
</p>
<h2>Decisive and Response Actions</h2>


<p>
Decisive Actions are actions that must be performed on your turn during fast times. Response Actions are actions that are done in response to something outside your turn. 
</p>
<p>
For each additional standard action you take in a round of Fast Times beyond the first, you take one penalty to your roll.
