<h1>The Adventurer's Guild and Guild Parties</h1>

The Adventurer’s Guild is an organization and system where people can take up the role of adventurer and complete various tasks for the good of society and the realm. People either do these tasks alone (solo) or with a group (with a party). Different adventurers and adventuring parties have names, and have various levels of fame and recognition. In fact, the Adventurer’s Guild gives all of its members a “level” which start at 1 and go to 12.

The Adventurer’s Guild Hall offers a notice board where people can post requests. These are sorted by difficulty level and include monster extermination, retrieval of lost items, escort and bodyguard services, and others.
