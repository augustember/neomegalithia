<h2>1.Choose a Name</h2>


<p>
It can be whatever.
</p>
<h2>2. Get Your Starting Level</h2>


<p>
As a brand new character you start at level<strong> 1.</strong>
</p>
<h2>3. Get Your Core Bonuses</h2>


<p>
Your core bonuses are the main numbers that add on to your dice rolls for skills and abilities. As a level 1, your big, medium, and small core bonuses are <strong>+3, +2, and +1</strong> respectively.
</p>
<p>
These bonuses are assigned to your abilities and skills.
</p>
<h2>4. Determine Skill Bonuses and Thresholds</h2>


<p>
Your Main Skills are Strength, Athletics, and Wisdom. Assign your <strong>Big, Medium and Small bonuses </strong>among these<strong> 3 skills.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Your expertise skills are Charm, Detection, Inspect, Medicine, Knowledge, Stealth, and Survival. 
</p>
<p>
Select <strong>2</strong> skills to receive your Big Core Bonus, another <strong>2</strong> skills to receive your Medium Bonus, and <strong>2</strong> additional skills for your <strong>Small Bonus</strong>. Any remaining skills start with a bonus of +<strong>0 </strong>and threshold of <strong>10.</strong>
</p>
<p>
All of your skills have numbers called thresholds which serve as target numbers for various things to roll against. A threshold is determined by 10 plus whichever Core Bonus a skill has been assigned to it plus whatever gear bonus a particular piece of equipment may be granting for that threshold. In other words:
</p>
<p>
The Threshold of all skills is determined with the formula  <strong>10 + [Core Bonus Value] + [Gear Increase] + [Trait Increase] . </strong>
</p>
<h2>5. Starting Experience Points</h2>


<p>
Your experienced points allow you to gain levels when they meet certain thresholds. Perhaps unsurprisingly, your experience points start at <strong>0 as a level 1</strong>. 
</p>
<h2>6. Select a Species</h2>


<p>
Pick one species from the Playable Species section further down. Each species has distinct traits and abilities. Choose one that fits your vision for your character's strengths, weaknesses, and cultural background. The playable species are: <strong>Faun, Minotaur, and Merfolk</strong>. 
</p>
<p>
Your starting Encumbrance Capacity, HP maximum, Energy Maximum, Size, and Speed are determined by which ability you choose. You gain all the benefits of your chosen species as described in their respective sections.
</p>
<h2>7. Get Starting Available Actions</h2>


<p>
As a level 1 you get:<strong> 2 standard actions</strong> and<strong> 1 extra action.</strong> 
</p>
<h2>8. Determine Your Defense Scores</h2>


<p>
Defense scores are numbers which represent how much damage you negate when you take damage (what some RPGs call <em>soak)</em>. Natural Defense represents your innate ability to withstand damage whereas Armor Defense represents equipment which is allowing you to withstand damage. Certain species grant you a certain Natural Defense number and some armor you get from equipment grants you a number for your Armor Defense. Your Defense Total is the combination of Natural and Armor Defense Scores. 
</p>



<p><i>For example, if you had a Natural Defense of 1 and you were wearing armor which granted you an Armor Defense of 2, then your Defense Total would be 3. And so when you take damage, you would subtract that damage amount from this Defense Total. </i></p>


<h2>9. Acquire Your Starting Ability Rank, Starting, Abilities</h2>


<p>
You have an Ability Rank which starts at Novice. Your Ability Rank applies across all abilities that you have gained. 
</p>
<p>
You receive all of the Default Abilities. You may take <strong>3</strong> abilities for each Rank of ability you are qualified for (with the exception for your default abilities). For each of those <strong>3 </strong>chosen abilities, assign your <strong>3 Core Bonuses</strong> among them.
</p>
<h2>10. Gain Some Traits</h2>


<p>
You get <strong>1 Knowledge Trait, 1 Basic Trait, and 1 Powerful trait</strong> of your choosing among those trait types listed in the Traits section.
</p>
<h2>11. Equip Your Character</h2>


<p>
Select your items and equipment from the starting equipment section. You have several slots which you may use to equip your various pieces of gear.
