<h2>11. Determine Your Damage Buffers </h2>


<p>
Damage Buffers are numbers which represent how much damage you negate when you take damage (what some RPGs call <em>soak)</em>. Natural Defense represents your innate ability to withstand damage whereas Armor Defense represents equipment which is allowing you to withstand damage. Certain species grant you a certain Natural Defense number and some armor you get from equipment grants you a number for your Armor Defense. Your Defense Total is the combination of Natural and Armor Defense Scores. 
</p>



<p><i>For example, if you had a Natural Defense of 1 and you were wearing armor which granted you an Armor Defense of 2, then your Defense Total would be 3. And so when you take damage, you would subtract that damage amount from this Defense Total. </i></p>
