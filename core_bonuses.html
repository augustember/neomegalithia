<h1 id="bonuses-and-thresholds">Bonuses, Thresholds, and Penalties</h1>


<p>
Skills both feature bonuses and thresholds, which directly influence the outcome of actions within the game. While Core Bonuses for a skill will increase that skill's threshold, the same is not true for a roll's advantage bonus.
</p>
<h2>Bonuses</h2>


<p>
Bonuses enhance your rolls, adding to the total outcome. If you receive multiple bonuses of the same type, only the highest applies. Bonuses are categorized into:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Core Bonuses: Your Big, Medium and Small bonuses.

<li>Advantage Bonuses: Granted under specific conditions (e.g., high ground, cover), offering situational improvements to rolls.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The formula for a skill or ability roll is:
</p>
<p>
<strong>3d6 + Core Bonus + Advantage Bonus (where applicable) = Result</strong>
</p>
<h2>Stacking Bonuses</h2>


<p>
Bonuses of different types can stack with one another, but ones of the same kind cannot. For example, if more than one thing would grant you a certain Advantage Bonus, you would take whichever one was highest.
</p>
<h2>Skill Bonuses</h2>


<p>
Skills use their corresponding Core Bonus for their roll. Otherwise the bonus for a Skill roll is +0. 
</p>
<h2>Thresholds</h2>


<p>
Thresholds serve as the target numbers others must meet or exceed to successfully affect you. They apply to skills (determined with the formula in the Character Creation section<strong>).</strong> For example, an Agility bonus of +2 results in an Agility Threshold of 14, making it the number opponents need to beat to successfully target actions against your Agility. 
</p>
<p>
The formula for determining Skill Thresholds is:<br><br> <strong>10 + [Core Bonus Value] + [Gear Increase] + [Trait Increase]. </strong>The Gear Increase is the value granted by certain gear. This value only applies when you are wearing that piece of equipment. Certain traits grant an increase to certain thresholds as well, which are permanent, unlike the threshold increase granted from gear.
</p>
<h2>Highest Bonus</h2>


<p>
The highest bonus refers to your highest Core Bonus.
</p>
<h2>Corresponding Bonus</h2>


<p>
This refers to the specific Core Bonus that is associated with that Skill or Ability.
</p>
<h2>Advantage Bonus</h2>


<p>
An additional bonus that can affect any roll, granted by situational advantages, traits, effects from gear, or abilities. This bonus stacks with other bonuses.
</p>
<h2>1d6 Penalties</h2>


<p>
Sometimes a penalty applies to a roll or threshold for whatever reason. A 1d6 penalty means you roll 1 less die than normal. Penalties do not stack. If you receive more than one source that would give you a penalty for the same thing, you still take 1d6 penalty. Penalties to thresholds may vary.
</p>

<h2>Temporary Threshold Decreases</h2>
<p>
While bonuses sometimes receive a 1d6 penalty, your thresholds may sometimes get a Temporary Threshold Decrease. This is a number that is subtracted from your usual threshold for that skill. If you would get more than one Temporary Threshold Decrease from more than one source that affect the same threshold, then only the highest one applies.
