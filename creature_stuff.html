<h1>Creature Stuff</h1>

<h2>Size of a Creature</h2>
Creatures vary in size, each occupying a specific amount of 2-dimensional space on the grid, viewed from above. This space is measured in square feet (sq ft) and determines how much area they cover on the grid. For clarity:
Playable Species: Typically occupy 5 sq ft, which means they cover an area equivalent to 5 square feet on the grid. This designation doesn't necessarily mean they are 5 feet wide but that they control this amount of space in combat and interaction scenarios.
Larger Creatures: Some creatures occupy 10 sq ft of space, doubling the area controlled by standard playable species. Despite this larger space, they might be colloquially referred to as "5 sq ft creatures" for simplicity, though it would be clearer to refer to them based on the actual space they occupy, such as "10 sq ft creatures."
Smaller Creatures: These occupy 2.5 sq ft, taking up less space on the grid and offering unique tactical considerations due to their smaller size.
Tiny Creatures: Anything smaller than 2.5 sq ft is considered "tiny," indicating minimal space occupation on the grid and potentially special rules for interaction and combat.

<h2>Height of a Creature</h2>
Height just refers to the vertical reach of that character. These are generally listed by feet and inches, such as "5'1".

<h2>Occupying space</h2>
Any creature that is 5 square feet and above may not occupy the space of another creature that is equal to or greater than its size. The exceptions are 2.5 sqft creatures and smaller, where up to four 2.5 square foot creatures may occupy the same 5 square feet at once and 8 tiny creatures may occupy the same 5 sqft at once.
