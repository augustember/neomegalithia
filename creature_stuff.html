    <h2>Creature Size</h2>
    <p> In terms of size, creatures are described by the cube size they occupy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>5 Foot Cube:</strong> Standard size for most playable species.</li>
        <li><strong>10 Foot Cube:</strong> Larger creatures that take up more space.</li>
        <li><strong>2.5 Foot Cube:</strong> Smaller creatures with less spatial presence.</li>
    </ul>
Not that most creatures literally exactly conform to cubic dimensions, but when creatures are described with these cubic dimensions, they are considered to occupy that approximate amount of space.

    <h2>Occupying Space</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A 5 Foot Cube creature can't share its cube with another of equal or larger size.</li>
        <li>Smaller creatures can coexist in the same cube depending on their size.</li>
    </ul>
