<h1>Health Points(HP) and Damage</h1>

<H2>Health</h2>
<p>This is a number that represents how much damage you can take. Your health has something called a damage pool. When you have taken more damage in your damage pool than your health, you die. When you rest all of your damage chips you have received are removed from your damage pool.</p>

<h2>Damage</h2>
<p>
The more damage you have, the closer you are to dying. Damage is given to you in the form of chips representing a damage type. The chips have two sides: the active side and stabilized side. You receive the active side first when receiving damage, and various effects such as being being healed convert a given chip to its stabilized version. When you are healed, you are given a certain number of restoration points. A restoration point can either convert an active chip of damage to its stabilized version, or take away that damage chip entirely if that damage is already its stabilized version.</p>
<p>As long as you as a damage chip is active it gives some kind of effect, while a stabilized version does not, except both an active and stabilized damage chip is still damage which counts against your health.</p>
</p>
<h2>Damage Types</h2>


<p>
Types of damage in Terra Megalithia encompass a variety of forms, each with its unique properties and effects on targets:
</p>
<h3>Blood</h3>

<p>
As long as a blood chip is active in your damage pool, you receive an additional damage chip every round. You don't receive more than one when this happens.

<h3>Corrosive</h3>


<p>
For every active chip of corrosive damage you take, you choose a piece of your equipment to be destroyed and unusable.
</p>
<h3>Fire</h3>

<p>
Elemental damage caused by fire. Can ignite flammable materials and is especially potent against ice-based creatures or in cold environments. For every active chip of fire damage you have, you receive a penalty to your attack rolls, which start at d6 and can increase to d8, or from d8 up to d10, or d10 up to d12. 
</p>

<h3>Freezing</h3>

<p>
Elemental damage from ice, frost, or chilling winds. Can slow down or freeze enemies, making it particularly effective against those susceptible to cold. As long as you have an active chip of freezing damage, your movement speed is halved.
</p>


<h3>Force</h3>

<p>
For every active chip of force damage you have, you receive a penalty to your defense rolls, which start at d6 and can increase to d8, or from d8 up to d10, or d10 up to d12. 
</p>


<h3>Plasma</h3>

<p>
The damage of things such as lightning. Plasma damage is devastating against most targets, capable of burning and electrocuting simultaneously, making it a rare but fearsome force. As long as you have an active chip of plasma damage, you lose your extra action. 
</p>

<h3>Haste</h3>

<p>
As long as you have an active chip of haste damage, you movement speed is doubled and you gain an additional standard action per round. That standard action goes the turn after you received this damage type. At the beginning of every round, you receive 1 more haste damage. You may shake off this damage.
</p>

<h3>Regeneration</h3>
<p>
For each active chip of regeneration damage, at the beginning of every round this removes another damage chip from your damage pool of your choice. At the beginning of every round, you receive 1 more regeneration damage. As an extra action on or outside of your turn, you may shake off this damage.
</p>

<h3>Silence</h3>
<p>
As long as you have an active chip of silence damage, you may not perform magical abilities. You have more than 1 active silence damage at a time.
</p>


<h3>Scary</h3>
<p>
As long as you have you have an active chip of scary damage, you run away and hide from danger. You have more than 1 active scary damage at a time.
</p>


<h3>Magical Toxicity</h3>
<p>
Many effects of abiities give this type of damage as a side-effect of their overall effects.
</p>



<h3>Bonus-Giving Damage</h3>
<p> For every active chip of bonus damage you have you receive a bonus to your rolls, which start at d6 and can increase to d8, or from d8 up to d10, or d10 up to d12. You may shake off this damage.
</p>


<h2>Strengths, Weaknesses, and Immunities</h2>


<p>
Creatures and things may be strong, weak, or immune to the effects of certain types. When a creature is weak to a thing, it takes double the amount of damage from that source. If it’s strong against it it deals half the amount. If the target is immune to that damage type, it deals no damage.
</p>
<h2>Damage Calculation For Weapons and Abilities</h2>


<p>
Some abilities (and nearly all weapons) deal damage. The following information gets into the specifics of rolling for that damage.
</p>
<h3>Dice Rolls for Weapon and Ability Damage</h3>


<p>
Each damaging ability has Partial and Large Damage which correspond to your natural dice roll (without modifiers). Your bonus used for this roll does not count towards rolling for damage. Those damages correspond as follows:
</p>
<ul>

<li><h3><strong>If the dice roll a natural 8 or fewer deal the ability’s Partial Damage.</h3>

<li><h3>If the dice roll a natural 8 or greater deal the ability’s Full Damage.</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Whenever you see a damage listing that looks like x/y (where x and y are numbers in a sequence), that is referring to the Partial and Full Damage values for that weapon or ability.
</p>

<h3>Core Bonus Damage</h3>


<p>
Core Bonus Damage is added damage by an amount equal to the Core Bonus used for a damaging ability. For example, for a weapon attack where you are using +4 Strength as your Core Bonus, you would add +4 extra damage. This extra damage shares the same damage type as the ability you are rolling damage for.
</p>
<h3>Special Rolls</h3>




<ul>

<li><strong>Doubles and Triples</strong>(two or three dice showing the same result): These doubles and triples “explode.” Calculate the current damage total. Then reroll the matching dice. Any dice not involved in the initial roll that now match the result of the rerolled dice also become part of the explosion, and you reroll them as well. Add all rerolled dice's damage to the total.

<li>Dice showing <strong>1s or 2s</strong> are excluded from forming doubles or triples.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Falling Damage</h3>


<p>
When falling from a height over 10 feet, the damage starts at 2/4 force damage for 15 feet, and each of those damage sizes increases by +2 for each 10 feet thereafter. 
</p>


<h2>Shaking Off Damage</h2>


<p>
Certain types of damage can be shaken off, and therefore are removed entirely from your damage pool. Damage which can be shaken off do not need to convert to their stabilized versions, they are simply removed once shaken off. However, you may only shake off this damage on your turn as an extra action.
</p>

<h2>Propogation</h2>

<p>
Some damage propogates. This means that type of damage increases by 1 at the beginning of every round if there is at least 1 of that type of active damage within your damage pool. 
</p>

<h2>Lifespan</h2>

<p>
Some damage has a lifespan. This means it only propogates up to a certain amount, and then all of that damage is removed from your damage pool once its lifespan ends. The counter for its lifespan increases by 1 at the beginning of around, and after its lifespan number is hit, the removal of every chip of that damage type happens at the end of tha round. If something would cause you to have more of a certain damage type than it has a lifespan for, then all of that damage type is removed from your damage pool.
