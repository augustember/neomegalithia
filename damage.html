<h1>Health Points(HP) and Damage</h1>

<H2>Health Points</h2>
<p>These are numbers that represent how healthy you are. You have an HP maximum and Current HP. When your current HP reaches 0, you take a wound and your HP is now 1. If you receive 3 wounds, you die. When you rest your current HP restores to its maximum HP and all wounds are removed.</p>

<h2>Damage</h2>
<p>
Damage is a number that decreases from your current HP. This damage could be from hazards, abilities, weapons, or other sources. 
</p>
<h2>Damage Types</h2>


<p>
Types of damage in Terra Megalithia encompass a variety of forms, each with its unique properties and effects on targets:
</p>
<h3>Sharp</h3>


<p>
Damage from edged weapons or piercing attacks. Effective against lightly armored foes but may be less effective against heavily armored opponents.
</p>
<h3>Blunt</h3>


<p>
Damage from crushing or forceful impacts. Ideal for breaking through armor or stunning enemies, causing potential knock back or disorientation.
</p>
<h3>Corrosive</h3>


<p>
Known for its ability to eat away at various materials, including armor and weapons, rendering them less effective or even useless.
</p>
<h3>Fire</h3>


<p>
Elemental damage caused by fire, lava, or scalding steam. Can ignite flammable materials and is especially potent against ice-based creatures or in cold environments.
</p>
<h3>Ice</h3>


<p>
Elemental damage from ice, frost, or chilling winds. Can slow down or freeze enemies, making it particularly effective against those susceptible to cold.
</p>
<h3>Earth</h3>


<p>
Damage that encompasses crushing forces, tremors, and manipulation of the terrain itself. Effective in disrupting balance and lowering defenses by altering the battlefield.
</p>
<h3>Air</h3>


<p>
Damage from powerful gusts, storms, and lightning. Can knock back or disorient opponents, and is effective against creatures grounded or resistant to physical damage.
</p>
<h3>Water</h3>


<p>
Damage from pressurized water, torrents, and cold depths. Can cause knock back, drenching (which may affect equipment), and is especially potent against fire-based creatures or in dry environments.
</p>
<h3>Plasma</h3>


<p>
The damage of things such as lightning. Plasma damage is devastating against most targets, capable of burning and electrocuting simultaneously, making it a rare but fearsome force.
</p>
<h3>Light</h3>


<p>
Radiant damage from sources of pure energy or light. Effective against creatures of darkness, shadows, or those harmed by sunlight. Can dispel illusions and reveal hidden entities.
</p>
<h3>Dark</h3>


<p>
Damage emanated from shadows, necrotic energy, or dark magic. It can drain life, weaken defenses, and is especially dangerous to beings of light or those sensitive to dark energies.
</p>
<h2>Strengths, Weaknesses, and Immunities</h2>


<p>
Creatures and things may be strong, weak, or immune to the effects of certain types. When a creature is weak to a thing, it takes double the amount of damage from that source. If it’s strong against it it deals half the amount. If the target is immune to that damage type, it deals no damage.
</p>
<h2>Damage Calculation For Weapons and Abilities</h2>


<p>
Some abilities (and nearly all weapons) deal damage. The following information gets into the specifics of rolling for that damage.
</p>
<h3>Dice Rolls for Weapon and Ability Damage</h3>


<p>
Each damaging ability has Partial and Large Damage which correspond to your natural dice roll (without modifiers). Your bonus used for this roll does not count towards rolling for damage. Those damages correspond as follows:
</p>
<ul>

<li><h3><strong>If the dice roll a natural 3-10 deal the ability’s Partial Damage.</h3>

<li><h3>If the dice roll a natural 11-18 deal the ability’s Full Damage.</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Whenever you see a damage listing that looks like x/y (where x and y are numbers in a sequence), that is referring to the Partial and Full Damage values for that weapon or ability.
</p>
<h3>Core Bonus Damage</h3>


<p>
Core Bonus Damage is added damage by an amount equal to the Core Bonus used for a damaging ability. For example, for a weapon attack where you are using +4 Strength as your Core Bonus, you would add +4 extra damage. This extra damage shares the same damage type as the ability you are rolling damage for.
</p>
<h3>Special Rolls</h3>


<ul>

<li><strong>Doubles and Triples</strong>(two or three dice showing the same result): These doubles and triples “explode.” Calculate the current damage total. Then reroll the matching dice. Any dice not involved in the initial roll that now match the result of the rerolled dice also become part of the explosion, and you reroll them as well. Add all rerolled dice's damage to the total.

<li>Dice showing <strong>1s or 2s</strong> are excluded from forming doubles or triples.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Falling Damage</h3>


<p>
When falling from a height over 10 feet, the damage starts at 2/4 for 15 feet, and each of those damage sizes increases by +2 for each 10 feet thereafter.
