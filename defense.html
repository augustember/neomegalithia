<h1 id="buffer">Damage Buffer</h1>


<p>Damage Buffer Scores allow you to negate a certain amount of damage that you take. You are granted defense by equipment you wear and also your innately endowed Natural Buffer, which is granted by your species and certain traits. 

<p><i>For example, if you have 1 Natural Buffer and 2 Armor Buffer and you receive 7 damage, you would only take 4 damage since your Defense Total negates 3 of that damage.</i>

<p>
<strong>Natural Buffer</strong>
</p>
<p>
This is your body’s natural ability to withstand damage.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Armor Buffer</strong>
</p>
<p>
This is the number given from worn equipment that allows you to withstand damage.
</p>


<strong>Defense Total</strong>
</p>
<p>
Your defense total is a number that subtracts from most damage you take granted from armor, your Natural Buffer, and sometimes other sources.
