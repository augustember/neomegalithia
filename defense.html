<p>Defense Scores allow you to negate a certain amount of damage that you take. You are granted defense by equipment you wear and also your innately endowed Natural Defense, which is granted by your species and certain traits. 

<p><i>For example, if you have 1 Natural Defense and 2 Armor Defense and you receive 7 damage, you would only take 4 damage since your Defense Total negates 3 of that damage.</i>

<p>
<strong>Natural Defense</strong>
</p>
<p>
This is your body’s natural ability to withstand damage.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Armor Defense</strong>
</p>
<p>
This is the number given from worn equipment that allows you to withstand damage.
</p>


<strong>Defense Total</strong>
</p>
<p>
Your defense total is a number that subtracts from most damage you take granted from armor, your natural defense, and sometimes other sources.
