<h1>Design Goals</h1>
<p>This section is mostly for me to remember what my aims for this project are.</p>

<p>So, some stuff:
<li>Keep things relatively simple and elegant.</li>
<li>Try to avoid mechanics that are cumbersome for players.</li>
<li>Find ways around stacking.</li>
<li>Be careful with exceptions to X rule.</li>
<li>Player autonomy is incredibly important.</li>
<li>Game is designed with casuals in mind, but has enough depth under the hood that grognards can enjoy it... probably.</li>
