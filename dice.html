<h2>Dice Rolls</h2>


<p>
Normal rolls to determine outcomes use 3 six-sided dice (referred to as d6s). The procedure for rolling goes:
</p>
<ol>

<li>Determine what you are rolling for. If it’s for an ability, the ability says what the Core Bonus you can apply for the role, and of course you may use the bonus of that ability’s type.

<li>Determine any modifiers or situational bonuses or penalties that apply to this role or the target number you are rolling against.

<li>Roll against the target.

<li>If you succeed, the ability’s effect happens.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Rolling Against</h2>


<p>
Dice rolls are almost always rolled against some static target number. This might be against a creature’s Agility Threshold or against an obstacle’s difficulty rating. Something will specify what such-and-such is rolling with and against. For instance, a roll might say “Melee vs Agility Threshold.”
</p>
<h2>Succeeding on a Roll</h2>


<p>
To determine the success of an action, follow these steps using four six-sided dice (3d6):
</p>
<ol>

<li>Identify the Action: Understand the action, skill, or ability being attempted. 

<li>Calculate Modifiers: Add any relevant modifiers to the roll. This includes the Bonus related to the action, and Advantage Bonuses or penalties that might affect the roll or the target number you're attempting to beat.

<li>Determine the Target: Most dice rolls are made against a static target number. This target could be defined by various factors within the game, such as a creature’s Agility Threshold for a physical attack or an obstacle’s difficulty rating for a skill check. The specific target number will usually be provided by the scenario or the rules governing the action you're taking.

<li>Roll the Dice: Roll 3d6 and add the calculated modifiers from step 2 to the total.

<li>Compare the Result: If the total of your roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target number determined in step 3, the action or ability succeeds. The effects of the ability then take place.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Automatic Hits</h2>


<p>
Certain descriptions or effects may refer to automatic hits. These are instances which would otherwise require a roll, but in that instance, do not.
</p>

<h2>Ability Rolls</h2>


<p>
This refers to the dice roll of a particular ability which uses that ability's Core Bonus which was assigned to it.
