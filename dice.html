    <h1>Dice and Rolling</h1>

    <section id="preparing-for-roll">
        <h2>Preparing for a Roll</h2>
        <p>Every action in the game involves a dice roll to determine its success. Here's the step-by-step process:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Dice Selection:</strong> Use the core die that you assigned to that skill or ability, ranging from d6 to d12. This die is complemented by a helper die, which starts at d6 and may grow in size at certain levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Applying Modifiers:</strong> Identify and apply any bonus or penalty dice based on conditions, character state, or equipment.</li>
            <li><strong>Executing the Roll:</strong> Roll the skill or ability die along with the helper die and modifiers against the Target Threshold to see if the action succeeds.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics">
        <h2>Dice Mechanics</h2>
        <p>Understanding static targets, thresholds, and success criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Static Targets and Thresholds:</strong> Actions are measured against static numbers that represent the difficulty of the action or an opponent's defense.</li>
            <li><strong>Success and Its Implications:</strong> Success is achieved by meeting or exceeding the Target Threshold, triggering the intended effects of the action.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
	
	<section id="Core Dice">
        <h2>Core Dice</h2>
		<p></p>
	
	<section id="bonus and penalty dice">
        <h2>Bonus and Penalty Dice</h2>
		<p>Bonus dice are rolled alongside your helper die and core die and add on to your roll. Penalty dice also roll alongside the rest of your dice you are rolling, except these subtract from your roll.
	</section>
	
	<section id="helper die">
	<h2>Helper</h2>
	<p>This is a die which always rolls alongside the core die of an ability. These start at d6 but increase at certain levels.
	</section>
	
	<section id="stacking dice types">
	<h2>Stacking Dice Types</h2>
	<p>If you would gain multiple of the same type of die for the same roll, you roll all of those dice and take the highest result for that type.
	</section>

    <section id="special-considerations">
        <h2>Special Considerations</h2>
        <p>Key points on automatic successes and conducting ability checks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Automatic Successes:</strong> Certain conditions grant automatic successes, bypassing the need for a roll.</li>
            <li><strong>Conducting an Ability Check:</strong> Roll the dice assigned to an ability against its threshold to determine the outcome.</li>
        </ul>
