<h2>Difficulty Ratings and Player Rolls</h2>


<p>
Determining Success: When faced with a challenge, players roll three six-sided dice (3d6) and add relevant modifiers based on their character's abilities, skills, and situational bonuses. The sum of this roll is compared against a static target number defined by the Difficulty Rating of the task (Easy: 10, Normal: 14, Hard: 18, Very Hard: 24).
</p>
<h3>Modifiers</h3>


<p>
Include Core Bonuses relevant to the action being attempted, and any situational advantages (e.g., high ground, surprise).
</p>
<h3>Outcome </h3>


<p>
If the total equals or exceeds the Difficulty Rating, the attempt is successful. Otherwise, the attempt fails, and the game narrative advances accordingly.
</p>

<h2>Difficulty Dice Against Player Thresholds</h2>


<p>
In scenarios where the challenge actively opposes the player (e.g., traps, environmental hazards, enemy abilities), the game uses Difficulty Dice. Instead of players rolling against a static number, the challenge rolls against one of the player's thresholds (such as Agility Threshold or Strength Threshold).
</p>
<h3>Rolling Difficulty Dice </h3>


<p>
The GM rolls a set of dice determined by the challenge's level of difficulty. The result is then added to any fixed modifiers inherent to the challenge.
</p>
<h3>Comparing Against Thresholds </h3>


<p>
The total from the Difficulty Dice roll is compared to the relevant player threshold. Player thresholds are calculated based on their Core Bonuses and possibly modified by gear, abilities, and situational factors.
</p>
<h3>Outcomes</h3>


<p>
If the Difficulty Dice total equals or exceeds the player's threshold, the challenge overcomes the player's defense, resulting in a negative effect (damage, status ailment, etc.). If the total falls short of the threshold, the player successfully resists or avoids the challenge's effect.

<p><i>Example Scenario: Avoiding a Trap
Trap Activation: A character triggers a pressure plate, activating a dart trap.
Difficulty Dice Roll: The GM rolls Difficulty Dice for the trap, aiming to beat the character's Agility Threshold to determine if the dart hits.
Character's Defense: The character's Agility Threshold might be calculated as 10 + (Agility bonus × 4), adjusted for situational modifiers (such as being alert to traps).</p>
<p><i>Result: If the trap's roll meets or exceeds the character's Agility Threshold, the dart hits, causing damage or other effects. If the roll is lower, the character dodges or the dart misses.</i></p>
