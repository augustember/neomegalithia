<h1 id="dungeons">Dungeons</h1>


<p>
In Terra Megalithia, dungeons may consist of various ruins and strongholds embedded within the earth. Adventurers who dare to traverse their depths will encounter not only perilous traps and fierce creatures but also the chance to unlock age-old mysteries.
</p>
<h2>Puzzles</h2>


<p>
In Terra Megalithia, puzzles serve as gateways to ancient wisdom and hidden chambers. Crafted by the old magics, these conundrums challenge adventurers to think beyond brute force, often requiring a blend of logic, intuition, and knowledge of ancient lore to solve. Successful navigation through these puzzles not only progresses the journey but can also unlock powerful artifacts and secret knowledge.
</p>
<h2>Hazards</h2>


<p>
Hazards are fairly diverse, ranging from natural dangers like quicksand and poisonous plants to magical anomalies that defy the laws of nature. Adventurers must tread carefully, as the environment itself can be as much of an adversary as any creature. 
</p>
<h3>Common Hazards</h3>


<ul>

<li>Quicksand: Hidden beneath seemingly stable ground, quicksand can quickly engulf an unwary traveler. The quicksand rolls a +1 roll against your Agility Threshold or Strength.

<li>Poisonous Plants: Touching or ingesting these can inflict damage or adverse conditions. Knowledge of nature might help identify these hazards. 

<li>Unstable Floors: Floors that suddenly give way, leading to pits or lower levels of the dungeon. These unstable floors roll a +1 roll vs your Agility Threshold.

<li>Dimness: Area where it is pretty dark. You take a penalty to your detect roll and detect score.

<li>Darkness: Areas where natural light is extinguished, impairing vision and making navigation difficult without magical aid or heightened senses. You take a penalty to your detect roll and detect threshold.

<li>Elemental Anomalies: Patches of extreme cold or heat, or areas where the air is electrified, challenging adventurers to find safe passage or suffer elemental damage. When you encounter these, they roll a certain roll with bonus vs your Strength.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Traps</h2>


<p>
Crafted by ancient protectors or cunning denizens, traps in Terra Megalithia are a deadly test of awareness and Agility. From hidden pits to arcane snares, each trap is a lethal lesson in caution, designed to protect treasures or keep intruders at bay.
</p>
<h3>Spotting Traps</h3>


<p>
In order to avoid a trap first you must know of its existence. There are particular rolls you must make against certain difficulties to spot them. If someone who has spotted a trap lets you know about it, you may avoid it as well.
</p>
<h3>Avoiding</h3>


<p>
Knowing about a trap doesn’t necessarily mean you will not trigger it. You must make certain rolls against the difficulty of the situation in order to not make the trap go off.
</p>
<h3>Disarming</h3>


<p>
This is a roll which makes the trap ineffective and therefore will not trigger.
</p>
<h3>Triggering Traps</h3>


<p>
This is a roll against you which causes certain negative effects. 
</p>

<h2 id="creature-encounters">Creature Encounters</h2>


<p>
The lands of Terra Megalithia are crawling with creatures both mystical and monstrous. Encounters can range from hostile skirmishes with territorial beasts to alliances with sentient beings holding the keys to deeper mysteries. Each encounter is an opportunity for combat, diplomacy, or wisdom?
</p>
<h2>Treasure</h2>


<p>
The dungeons and wilds of Terra Megalithia are laden with treasures that span the spectrum from ancient artifacts imbued with powerful magic to simple, yet valuable, relics of the past. Securing such treasures often involves braving the aforementioned challenges and unlocking the secrets of the land.
</p>
<h2>Walls, Doors, and Common Fixtures</h2>


<p>
When you're delving into ancient ruins or creeping through mystical forests, it's not just the creatures and the sprawling landscape you need to pay attention to. The very walls, doors, and floors underfoot are characters in their own right, each with a story to tell and secrets to hide. Here's a rundown on that stuff.
</p>
<h3>Walls</h3>


<p>
Let’s get real–you know what walls are. Walls are vertical structures designed to enclose, divide, or protect an area, typically made from materials like stone, brick, wood, or concrete. They serve various purposes, including defense, privacy, and support for buildings and other structures.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Material Matters </strong>
</p>
<p>
Whether made of ancient stone, entwined with living vines, or constructed from the bones of colossal beasts, the material of a wall can offer clues about the area's history and the magic that might permeate the space.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Secrets Held Tight</strong>
</p>
<p>
Always be on the lookout for subtle hints of hidden doors or compartments. A seemingly innocuous wall might just be the gateway to untold riches or a shortcut to your destination.
</p>
<h3>Doors</h3>


<p>
Doors in Terra Megalithia are more than just points of entry or exit, oddly enough.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Locks </strong>
</p>
<p>
Many doors will be locked, requiring a key, a spell, or a bit of ingenuity to open. Some might even be sentient, requiring you to answer a riddle or prove your worth before they allow you passage.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Choose Wisely</strong>
</p>
<p>
Not every door should be opened. Some might be better left undisturbed, guarding dangers that are best avoided. Pay attention to the signs and symbols that adorn doorways; they might hold warnings or hints about what lies beyond.
</p>
<h3>Common Fixtures</h3>


<p>
From torch sconces that flicker with eternal flames to statues that watch your every move, the fixtures you come across in Terra Megalithia can be sources of light, lore, and sometimes, latent power. Interacting with them can reveal hidden mechanisms, activate ancient devices, or even trigger traps.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Light the Way</strong>
</p>
<p>
Torches and other light sources can be vital for navigating dark corridors or revealing the hidden details of a room. They can also serve as puzzle components or signal mechanisms to open secret passages.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Statues and Symbols </strong>
</p>
<p>
Statues are not always what they seem. Some may come to life, offering quests or challenges, while others might hold the key to unlocking the area's magic. Symbols and sigils can provide insights into the lore of Terra Megalithia or serve as clues for overcoming the challenges that lie ahead.
