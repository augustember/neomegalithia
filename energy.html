<p>
Energy is a number which is spent for performing various actions and abilities. Those actions have specific energy costs associated with them. You have current energy and maximum energy. 
</p>
<h2>Current and Maximum Energy</h2>


<p>
Your maximum energy is a number which determines how high your current energy can go. The amount of your maximum energy you begin with is set by the species of your character. Each rest your current energy refills to your maximum energy. 
</p>
<h2>Energy Cost</h2>


<p>
Different types of actions have varying energy costs. When an action is performed, that cost is subtracted from your current energy. 
</p>
<p>
<h2>Temporary Energy Increases</h2>
<p>Your maximum energy can be temporarily increased by wearing gear or the effects from certain abilities. Additionally, some items are designed to replenish your spent energy or temporarily elevate your current energy above its usual maximum.</p>
