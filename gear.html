<h1 id="gear">Gear</h1>


<p>
Pieces of gear grant certain effects. Weapons, relics, and armor are all considered gear. Gear must be equipped for their effects to happen.
</p>
<h2>Switching Equipment</h2>


<p>
If you need to equip something else during fast times, it costs 1 extra action.
</p>
<h2>Equipment and Equip Slots</h2>


<p>
Some items may be equipped. The effects of those items only happen when they are equipped. However, you have limited slots for a particular type of equipable item. Those slots are:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Head slot

<li>2 hand slots

<li>1 shoes slot

<li>1 armor slot

<li>2 relic slots

<li>1 glove slot

<li>1 strap slot
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Encumbrance</h2>


<p>
Items all have an encumbrance value. You have an encumbrance capacity which is determined by your species and sometimes the effects of gear you are wearing. If your items would cause you to have a greater encumbrance than you have encumbrance capacity for, you take a penalty on all ability rolls, any skill check using Agility, and your movement speed is reduced by half.
</p>
<h2>Switching Equipment</h2>


<p>
If you need to equip something else during fast times, it costs 1 extra action per piece of equipment being switched out.
</p>

<p>
You gain:
</p>
<ul>

<li>2 Weapons of your choice from the weapons section

<li>1 Piece of armor of your choice from the armor section + 1 shield

<li>1 of each of all the field items in the field items section

<li>1 of each of all the single-use items from the single-use section.
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="weapons">Weapons</h1>


<p>
Oddly enough, weapons are special tools used to attack. Weapons are used in tandem with various attack abilities.
</p>
<h2>Weapon Damage</h2>


<p>
Weapons, like abilities, have half and full damage values. The damage a weapon deals corresponds to the roll for an ability that used that weapon. 
</p>
