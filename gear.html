<h1>Equipment</h1>
<p>Pieces of gear, including weapons, relics, and armor, grant certain effects and must be equipped to provide their benefits.</p>
<h2>Switching Equipment</h2>
<p>Equipping or switching gear during Fast Times costs 1 extra action per piece of equipment being changed.</p>
<h2>Equipment and Equipment Slots</h2>
<p>You have limited Equip Slots for particular types of equipable items. These slots are different than your normal Item Slots. Item Slots are for what you are carrying, and Equipment Slots are for what you have ready to use, such as armor and weapons. The Equipment Slots are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Head slot:</b> For headgear such as helmets and hats.</li>
    <li><b>2 Hand Slots:</b> For things like weapons and shields wielded with your hands. Big items take up 2 Hand Slots, while Small items only take up.</li>
    <li><b>1 Shoes Slot:</b> For things like shoes and boots.</li>
    <li><b>1 Armor Slot:</b> For armor going over your torso.</li>
    <li><b>2 Relic Slots:</b> For accessories such as necklaces or rings which grant certain effects while wearing them.</li>
    <li><b>1 Glove Slot:</b> For gloves.</li>
    <li><b>1 Strap Slot:</b> For items which have you strap something to your arm or leg.</li>
</ul>



<h1>Weapons</h1>
<p>Weapons, crucial for attack abilities, must be equipped to use. Their damage, traits, and compatibility with abilities vary widely.</p>
<h2>Weapon Properties</h2>
<p>Weapons have traits defining their use and effects in combat, such as Melee, Ranged, Thrown, and more, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Base Damage:</b> The damage numbers a weapon does before you add the damage from your Core Bonus. This is listed in X/Y format, such as "3/6" where 3 in this example 3 is the weapon's Partial Damage and 6 is the weapon's Full Damage.</li>
    <li><b>Small/Big:</b> Dictates one-handed or two-handed use. Small equipment take up 1 Hand Slot while Big equipment take up 2 Hand Slots.</li>
    <li><b>Range X [Melee/Ranged]:</b> Specifies maximum range in feet for ranged attacks. It also specifies if that specified range is intended for a Melee or Ranged ability. </li>
    <li><b>Recall:</b> Allows thrown weapons to return to the wielder when thrown. Weapons without this tag must be retrieved from their target.</li>
	<li><b>Entangling:</b> Weapons with this trait can restrain targets on a successful hit, preventing them from moving away without first passing a Strength or Agility roll against your weapon's difficulty threshold as a Standard Action.</li>
	<li><b>Ammunition:</b> Weapons requiring ammunition need to be reloaded after each attack, which requires an Extra Action. You must have the specified type of ammunition in your inventory. Each attack reduces your ammunition count by one. Ammunition can be replenished through purchases in towns or crafting. 
</ul>

<h2>Retrieving Weapons</h2>

Weapons that do not possess the Recall trait and are used in ranged attacks must be retrieved manually. Retrieving a weapon from the ground requires you to be adjacent to it and consumes an Extra Action. If a weapon is thrown and hits multiple targets (via abilities), it lands in a space chosen by the Game Master, adjacent to one of these targets.
