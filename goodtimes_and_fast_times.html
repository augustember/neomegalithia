<h1 id="good-times-and-fast-times">Good Times and Fast Times</h1>


<p>
There are two distinct phases of gameplay: Good Times and Fast Times. These phases reflect the natural ebb and flow of daily life in the Neolithic fantasy setting, from peaceful interactions and exploration to the thrill of combat and immediate danger.
</p>
<h1 id="good-times-the-breath-between-battles">Good Times: The Breath Between Battles</h1>


<p>
Good Times are periods of relative calm, where characters engage in activities outside the immediacy of conflict. This phase allows for in-depth exploration, character development, and storytelling. During Good Times, players can:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Engage with the world around them, exploring ancient ruins, mystical forests, and tribal settlements.

<li>Interact with NPCs to forge alliances, gather information, or negotiate deals.

<li>Focus on crafting, using the land's raw materials to create tools, weapons, and mystical artifacts.

<li>Develop their characters through training, meditation, or performing rituals to commune with the spirits of nature.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In Good Times, the game's pace is dictated by narrative progression and player choices, rather than structured turns. In Good Times, you don’t have to worry about action costs (like Standard and Extra Actions). 
</p>

<h2>Initiating Fast Times</h2>


<p>
Fast Times is initiated by the Game Master whenever a fast-paced situation occurs, such as combat, a chase, or some other time-sensitive situation. When this happens all Action Card s are gathered and shuffled in the initiative deck.
</p>
<p>
There is often an initiator of Fast Times, like when someone wants to attack. You may iniate Fast Times by declaring intent to attack. If you declared an intent to attack first may may opt to take the first standard action of the round(so yournext standard action is skipped), but your first roll of the first round takes a 1d6 penalty. If you wanted to attack first
</p>
<h2>Fast Times Initiative</h2>


<p>
Initiative refers to what order all combatants’ turns go in (player characters and nonplayer characters).When Fast Times happen, all combatants are determined and all of their turns cards are shuffled into the initiative deck. The deck remains face down.
</p>
<h2>Determine Starting Positions</h2>


<ol>

<li>The Game Master establishes the Fast Times Zone. This is the location of this Fast Times instance. The Game Master may provide props such as a battle grid, terrain props, etc.

<li>The players decide where their characters are.

<li>The Game Master then decides positions of all the nonplayer characters in the Fast Times Zone.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
After that, you should all be ready for the first time to happen…
</p>
<h2>Turns</h2>


<p>
At the beginning of a turn, the Game Master draws an Action Card  from the top of the turn deck. If your card is flipped over, then it’s your turn! 
</p>
<p>
Each Action Card grants you a particular action that is available to you to use for the rest of the round it is drawn on. These cards give either extra actions or standard actions.
</p>
<p>
During your turn, you may make several available actions (number of standard and extra actions). These actions may be movement (usually a standard action), ability (could be a standard or extra action), or skill (usually a standard action). When you decide you are done or have used up all of your available actions for the round, your turn ends and it goes to the next combatant.

    <h2>Game Turn Structure</h2>
    <ul><ol type="1">
        <li>
            <strong>Draw Turn Card:</strong> The Game Master initiates each round by drawing an Action Card from the Initiative Deck. The character or NPC associated with the drawn card is up for their turn.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Perform Actions:</strong> The active participant, whether player or NPC, executes their actions during their turn. They may utilize their allotment of standard and extra actions to move, invoke abilities, or employ skills relevant to their strategy.
            <ul>
                <li><em>Standard Actions</em> typically involve significant activities such as moving across the battlefield, launching an attack, or casting a spell.</li>
                <li><em>Extra Actions</em> are reserved for less intensive tasks, including minor movements, quick interactions with objects, or the activation of certain quick-use abilities.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Conclude Turn:</strong> After expending available actions or electing to end their turn early, control passes back to the Game Master, who reveals the next Action Card from the deck.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cycle Through Participants:</strong> This process repeats, following the order dictated by the Initiative Deck, until all involved in the encounter have taken their turn.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Reset for Next Round:</strong> With the conclusion of a round, marked by the depletion of the Initiative Deck, the cycle begins anew. Turn Cards are reorganized according to their initial sequence for the upcoming round, ensuring a consistent order of action.
        </li>
		</ol>
    </ul>


</section>
<h2>Rounds</h2>


<p>
A round is everyone’s turn from the first turn to the last. When a round ends, all the turn cards are put back in the same sequence they were initially drawn, and the person who went first last round goes again. Certain effects trigger at the beginning or end of a round.
</p>
<p>

    <h2>Holding an Action</h2>
    <p>During Fast Times, players have the option to delay the use of their action to a later time within the same round.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Declare:</strong> When your Action Card is drawn, inform the Game Master that you wish to hold your action.</li>
        <li><strong>Execution:</strong> You may use your held action when your next Action Card is drawn (ie when it's your turn again), before taking any new actions for that turn.</li>
        <li><strong>Discard:</strong> After using any held actions (and any other used actions for that matter), place those Action Cards on top of the Action Discard Pile. In other words, where those held Action Cards are drawn for going forward for each round of the initiative order has changes. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>If a held action is not used by the time the player's next Action Card comes up, it is automatically forfeited.</p>



<h2>End of Round Stuff</h2>
</p>
<p>
At the end of every round, the effects of certain abilities are triggered or are changed. Any ability that says “for the next minute”’s counter goes down (and presumably started at 10).
</p>
<h2>Fast Times Ends When…</h2>


<p>
Fast Times end when the initiating challenge is resolved—through overcoming threats, achieving objectives, or successfully retreating—allowing the game to transition back to the narrative and exploration-focused Good Times.Basically, whenever the Game Master decides the situation is no longer fast-paced, then the game transitions back to Good Times.
