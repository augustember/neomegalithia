<h1>Gameplay Phases: Good Times and Fast Times</h1>

<h2>Good Times: Non-Combat Phase</h2>
<p>Character activities outside conflict are emphasized, including exploration, NPC interaction, and crafting. Actions costs do not apply, fostering narrative development and exploration.</p>

<h2>Fast Times: Combat and Urgent Scenarios</h2>
<p>Combat and time-sensitive scenarios. Characters become combatants, using Initiative and Action Cards to manage turns and actions.</p>

<h3>Initiating Fast Times</h3>
<p>Triggered by the GM, entering this phase introduces heightened action states for each participant, defined as combatants. Action Cards represent available Standard Actions. Extra Actions are separate and always available.</p>

<h4>Initiator Advantage</h4>
<p>The character initiating Fast Times may choose to act immediately with a Standard Action. This initial action, once taken, places their first Action Card at the end of the Initiative Order for that round.</p>

<h3>Initiative and Action Cards</h3>
<p>Combatants receive Action Cards corresponding to their Standard Actions. Extra Actions don't require cards and are freely available each round. The Initiative Deck, formed from shuffled Action Cards, dictates turn order. Used Action Cards are moved to the Initiative Discard Pile.</p>

<h3>Setting the Stage</h3>
<ol>
    <li>GM establishes the Fast Times Zone, setting up the environment and NPC positions.</li>
    <li>Players place their characters within this zone how they want.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Turn Dynamics</h3>
<p>When an action card of yours is draw, it's your turn. During a turn, a player can use their Standard and Extra Actions. Performing Standard actions cause their corresponding Action Cards to go to the Discard Pile. A player is not obligated to use any of her actions, and may decide to end her turn, in which case a new Action Card is drawn.</p>

<h3>Round Structure</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Starting Round:</strong> Activate start-of-round effects, replenish any Extra Actions that were used last round, and form a new Initiative Deck from the Discard Pile, preserving the order of cards the Discard Pile ended on.</li>
    <li><strong>During Round:</strong> Follow the Initiative Deck order for turns, allowing combatants to act. Perform actions, conclude turns, and cycle through all participants.</li>
    <li><strong>Ending Round:</strong> Trigger end-of-round effects. Unused Action Cards move to the Discard Pile.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Holding Actions</h3>
<p>Combatants may delay their actions for strategic use within the round. Unutilized actions by the round's end are forfeited, with their Action Cards going to the Discard Pile.</p>

<h3>Conclusion of Fast Times</h3>
<p>The phase ends when the initiating challenge is resolved. The transition back to Good Times is at the GM's discretion, signaling a return to narrative and exploration focus.</p>
