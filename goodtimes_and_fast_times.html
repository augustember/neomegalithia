<h1 id="good-times-and-fast-times">Good Times and Fast Times</h1>


<p>
There are two distinct phases of gameplay: Good Times and Fast Times. These phases reflect the natural ebb and flow of daily life in the Neolithic fantasy setting, from peaceful interactions and exploration to the thrill of combat and immediate danger.
</p>
<h1 id="good-times-the-breath-between-battles">Good Times: The Breath Between Battles</h1>


<p>
Good Times are periods of relative calm, where characters engage in activities outside the immediacy of conflict. This phase allows for in-depth exploration, character development, and storytelling. During Good Times, players can:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Engage with the world around them, exploring ancient ruins, mystical forests, and tribal settlements.

<li>Interact with NPCs to forge alliances, gather information, or negotiate deals.

<li>Focus on crafting, using the land's raw materials to create tools, weapons, and mystical artifacts.

<li>Develop their characters through training, meditation, or performing rituals to commune with the spirits of nature.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In Good Times, the game's pace is dictated by narrative progression and player choices, rather than structured turns. In Good Times, you don’t have to worry about action costs (like Standard and Extra Actions). 
</p>

<h2>Initiating Fast Times</h2>
<p>
    Fast Times is initiated by the Game Master in response to fast-paced situations like combat or chases. This phase brings every creature involved into a state of heightened action, known as <i>combatants</i>. Each combatant receives Action Cards based on their available actions (e.g., 2 Standard Actions and 1 Extra Action equates to 2 Standard Action Cards and 1 Extra Action Card). These cards are then shuffled into the Initiative Deck, with an adjacent Initiative Discard Pile for used actions.
</p>
<p>
    An initiator of Fast Times, typically declaring an intent to attack, may opt for immediate engagement. Choosing this option allows the initiator to act first with a Standard Action but incurs a 1d6 penalty on their first roll of the round. This action is then skipped in the next cycle of their turns within the round. If this option is not selected, the initiator's actions are shuffled into the Initiative Deck as normal.
</p>

<h2>Fast Times Initiative</h2>


<p>
Initiative refers to what order all combatants’ turns go in (player characters and nonplayer characters).When Fast Times happen, all combatants are determined and all of their turns cards are shuffled into the initiative deck. The deck remains face down.
</p>
<h2>Determine Starting Positions</h2>


<ol>

<li>The Game Master establishes the Fast Times Zone. This is the location of this Fast Times instance. The Game Master may provide props such as a battle grid, terrain props, etc.

<li>The players decide where their characters are.

<li>The Game Master then decides positions of all the nonplayer characters in the Fast Times Zone.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
After that, you should all be ready for the first time to happen…
</p>
<h2>Turns</h2>


<p>
At the beginning of a turn, the Game Master draws an Action Card  from the top of the turn deck. If your card is flipped over, then it’s your turn! 
</p>
<p>
Each Action Card grants you a particular action that is available to you to use for the rest of the round it is drawn on. These cards give either extra actions or standard actions.
</p>
<p>
During your turn, you may make several available actions (number of standard and extra actions). These actions may be movement (usually a standard action), ability (could be a standard or extra action), or skill (usually a standard action). When you decide you are done or have used up all of your available actions for the round, your turn ends and it goes to the next combatant. Whenever you perform a type of action, the card which granted you that action goes in the Initiative Discard Pile face up.

    <h2>Game Turn Structure</h2>
    <ul><ol type="1">
        <li>
            <strong>Draw Turn Card:</strong> The Game Master initiates each round by drawing an Action Card from the Initiative Deck. The character or NPC associated with the drawn card is up for their turn.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Perform Actions:</strong> The active participant, whether player or NPC, executes their actions during their turn. They may use their allotment of standard and extra actions to move, invoke abilities, or employ skills relevant to their strategy.
            <ul>
                <li><em>Standard Actions</em> typically involve significant activities such as moving across the battlefield, launching an attack, or casting a spell.</li>
                <li><em>Extra Actions</em> are reserved for less intensive tasks, including minor movements, quick interactions with objects, or the activation of certain quick-use abilities.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Conclude Turn:</strong> After expending all of your available actions or electing to end your turn early, control passes back to the Game Master, who reveals the next Action Card from the deck.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cycle Through Participants:</strong> This process repeats, following the order dictated by the Initiative Deck, until all involved in the encounter have taken their turn.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Reset for Next Round:</strong> With the conclusion of a round, marked by the depletion of the Initiative Deck, the cycle begins anew. Turn Cards are reorganized according to their initial sequence for the upcoming round, ensuring a consistent order of action.
        </li>
		</ol>
    </ul>


</section>
<h2>Rounds</h2>


<p>
A round is everyone’s turn from the first turn to the last. When a round ends, all the turn cards are put back in the same sequence they were initially drawn, and the person who went first last round goes again. Certain effects of abilities or hazards may trigger at the beginning or end of a round, such as extra health gained from the Regeneration ability.
</p>
<p>

    <h2>Holding an Action</h2>
    <p>During Fast Times, you don't have to use your action card (which grants you a certain action type) on your turn. You may instead hold your action. When an Action Card is drawn, the player may choose not to act immediately, opting instead to hold one or more (if applicable) actions to use later in the same round.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Declare Holding:</strong> Inform the Game Master that you are holding your action instead of using it when your Action Card is drawn.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple Actions:</strong> If multiple Action Cards for the same player are drawn consecutively, the player may choose to hold actions from each card, accumulating actions for later use in the round.</li>
        <li><strong>Using Held Actions:</strong> Held actions can be used at any point before the player's turn ends, including when another of their Action Cards is drawn.</li>
        <li><strong>Forfeiture of Actions:</strong> If the player ends their turn without using all available actions, and there are no additional Action Cards for that player to be drawn in the current round, all unused actions are forfeited. </li>
        <li><strong>Discard:</strong> After a held action (or any other action) is used, or if the round ends and the action is forfeited, place the Action Card(s) on top of the Action Discard Pile.</li>
    </ol>



<h2>Fast Times Ends When…</h2>
<p>
Fast Times end when the initiating challenge is resolved—through overcoming threats, achieving objectives, or successfully retreating—allowing the game to transition back to the narrative and exploration-focused Good Times.Basically, whenever the Game Master decides the situation is no longer fast-paced, then the game transitions back to Good Times.
