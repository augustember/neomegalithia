<h1>Gameplay Phases: Good Times and Fast Times</h1>

<h2>Good Times: Non-Combat Phase</h2>
<p>Character activities outside conflict are emphasized, including exploration, NPC interaction, and crafting. Actions costs do not apply, fostering narrative development and exploration.</p>

<h2>Fast Times: Combat and Urgent Scenarios</h2>
<p>Involves combat and time-sensitive scenarios. Characters become combatants, with their actions and turn order governed by the Initiative system based on poker cards.</p>

<h3>Initiating Fast Times</h3>
<p>Triggered by the GM, this phase ushers participants into a heightened state of action, where each character is defined as a combatant.</p>

<h4>Initiator Advantage</h4>
<p>The character responsible for initiating Fast Times has the option to act first. If this privilege is exercised, the initiator forfeits their first turn in the upcoming Fast Times sequence.</p>

<h3>Turn Card Draws and Initiative</h3>
<p>Each combatant is allocated a number of turn card draws from a poker deck, determined by their attributes or traits. At the beginning of Fast Times, each combatant draws a number of turn cards equal to their Turn Card stat. These cards are placed face up in the Initiative Zone to set the turn order from greatest to least. In case of identical card values, resolution is cooperative among players, potentially unlocking special abilities. Tokens represent each combatant on their chosen card, and at the beginning of a new round, the process repeats.</p>

<h3>Setting the Stage</h3>
<ol>
    <li>GM establishes the Fast Times Zone, setting up the environment and NPC positions.</li>
    <li>Players position their characters within this zone as desired.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Turn Dynamics</h3>
<p>Combatants act in the order determined by their chosen initiative card. During their turn, they may execute actions permissible within the combat framework. Special considerations apply for turns with matching values, where combo abilities may be activated.</p>

<h3>Round Structure</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Starting Round:</strong> Activate start-of-round effects, such as all damage effects. Participants draw their turn cards to establish the new initiative order.</li>
    <li><strong>During Round:</strong> Follow the initiative order for turns, allowing combatants to act using their capabilities. Conclude turns and cycle through all combatants.</li>
    <li><strong>Ending Round:</strong> Implement end-of-round effects. All turn cards are collected and prepared for the next round's draw.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Dynamic Initiative</h3>
<p>Combatants have the potential to influence their initiative order through traits, allowing them more control over their turn placement.</p>

<h3>Conclusion of Fast Times</h3>
<p>The phase concludes once the initiating challenge is resolved, paving the way back to Good Times. This transition is at the GM's discretion.</p>
