<h1>Characters in Megalithia</h1>


<p>
Characters are the heart of the story, adventurers and heroes navigating a world of ancient secrets and burgeoning civilizations. Creating a character involves choosing a race, each with unique abilities and affinities that defines their skills and approach to challenges. Characters grow by mastering their abilities, acquiring gear, and making choices that shape their journey. In this world, characters must balance personal ambition with the needs of their communities, facing threats both mundane and supernatural. Success in Megalithia requires cleverness, bravery, and teamwork, as the world's mysteries unfold around the characters, inviting them to leave their mark on its history.
</p>
<p>
Characters have Core Bonuses, health points, energy points, defense points, turn cards, abilities, and skills which will be explained later.
