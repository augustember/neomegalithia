Mighty and formidable, Minotaurs are the guardians of ancient secrets and sacred sites. Their Strength is legendary, as is their unwavering honor. Living in the labyrinthine complexes of Terra Megalithia, they are both a symbol of protection and the challenge to those who dare to uncover the ancient mysteries they guard.
