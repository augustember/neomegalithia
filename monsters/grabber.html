    <br>Grabber chooses a creature target within 5 feet of itself. The target makes either a Toughness or Evasion vs 17 roll. On a failure, the target is grappled by Grabber, and the target's speed is reduced to 0 until the target is no longer grappled. As a Standard Action, the target may make an Evasion or Toughness vs 17 roll. If that roll hits, then the target is no longer grappled.

    <br>Grabber may only do this if he is already grappling a target. Grabber chooses a target he is presently grappling. The target makes an Evasion or Strength vs 18 roll. On a failure, the target receives 10/20 blunt damage.
