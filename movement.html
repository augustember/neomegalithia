<h2>Movement Speed and Terrain Types</h2>

Movement Speed is how fast a character across different movement types during a round of Fast Times (or 6 seconds).The Movement types are:
<li><b>Ground:</b> Your movement while moving on the ground.
<li><b>Flying:</b> Your movement while flying, if applicable.
<li><b>Swimming:</b> Your movement while swimming.

<p>If you see the term "Speed" with no additional quulifiers (ie it doesn't say something like "Flying Speed"), it's referring to Ground Speed. 

<p>
Movement speed is determined by the species of the character. Each increment of your movement speed is a Standard Action. However, you may split up the number of feet of your movement across multiple turns in a round as long as you have Standard Actions to cover it. However, if you use only a fraction of your movement increment as a Standard Action and a round ends, that movement does not carry over into the next round. 

<i>For example, if your speed is 30 and you have 2 Standard Actions available to you, you may move 15 feet (which partially uses 1 Standard Action), then use your second Standard Action to attack, the move another 15 feet-- all which costs you 2 Standard Actions.</i>
</p>
<p>
Characters can take actions to move up to their speed or use their speed in combination with actions like attacking or using abilities. Some abilities may specifically require or modify movement, such as charging attacks.
</p>
<h2>Terrain Types</h2>


<p>
The terrain over which characters move can affect their speed and require skill checks to navigate successfully. Here are common terrain types and their typical effects:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Normal Ground: No effect on movement; characters move at their base speed.

<li>Difficult Terrain (forests, rubble, shallow water): Costs double movement. Movement speed is halved.

<li>Impassable Terrain (deep water, thick walls): Cannot be crossed without special abilities or equipment.

<li>Slippery Surface (ice, wet floors): May require an Agility check to navigate without falling.

<li>Steep Terrain (steep hills, cliffs): May require a Strength or Agility check to climb.

<li>Flyable Airspace: Accessible only to characters who are able to fly. Movement speed may be affected by wind conditions.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Navigating Terrain</h2>


<p>
Characters need to make skill checks based on their Agility or Strength to navigate challenging terrain successfully. Failure could mean slower movement, falling prone, or even taking damage. The difficulty of these checks is determined by the GM based on the terrain's complexity and environmental conditions.
</p>
<h2>Escaping</h2>


<p>
Sometimes something may restrain you. To escape this restraint, you make an athletics roll vs the target’s Strength Threshold.
</p>
<h2>Climbing</h2>


<p>
Climbing normally requires no roll, though some difficulty climbing conditions will invoke one. However, your movement speed increment is halved while climbing. 
</p>
<p>
The following do require a roll to succeed, and these increase the increment of its difficulty (which start at 10):
</p>
<ul>

<li>Climbing a slick surface is athletics adds +6 difficulty

<li>Climbing a sheer surface adds +10 difficulty

<li>Every 5 feet climbed adds +5 difficulty
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Each additional 5 feet climbed for these instances add on
</p>
<h2>Jumping</h2>


<p>
You may want to jump in certain instances. Any vertical or long jump under 5 feet doesn’t require a roll. 
</p>
<h3>Vertical Jumping</h3>


<p>
This is for when you want to jump high for whatever reason. The roll for vertical jumping is athletics vs a difficulty rating, where for every 5 feet of the attempted vertical jump, the difficulty rating is increased by 14. 
</p>
<h3>Long Jumping</h3>


<p>
This is for when you want to jump across something, such as a pit.  The roll for long jumping is athletics vs difficulty rating, where for every 5 feet of the attempted long jump, the difficulty rating is increased by 10.
</p>
<h2>Terrain and Combat</h2>


<p>
During combat, terrain can provide cover, obstacles for strategic positioning, or hazards that can damage characters. Players and GMs should consider the terrain's role in combat scenarios, leveraging it for tactical advantages or dealing with its challenges.
</p>
<p>
Cover: Provides various temporary Agility Threshold increases against ranged attacks. The increases given are:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Partial cover: +4

<li>Half cover: +8

<li>Full cover: +12

<li>High Ground: May grant temporary bonuses to attack rolls.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Environmental Hazards: Lava flows, acid pools, and spikes can cause damage to characters who enter these terrains or end their turn there.
</p>
<h2>Modifying Movement</h2>


<p>
abilities, situations,, and gear can modify a character's movement speed or ability to navigate terrain. These modifications can temporarily increase speed, allow movement across normally impassable terrain, or even grant temporary abilities like flight or water-walking.
