		<p>This clone inherits the caster's physique. It carries mock versions of all physical appearance and basic knowledge.The clone is created within 5 feet of the caster and lasts until Fast Times end or until it takes any form of damage, at which point it poofs out of existence.</p>
		<p>
		<p>It can perform actions you could, with some limitations: It has 1 HP,  it cannot use abilities or actions that require energy, it lacks bonuses or thresholds in any of its skills, hits against it are automatic (require no roll), has mock versions of items which you were equipped or carrying which lack any benefit those things had, and has no Ability or Skill Ranks or Bonuses.</p>
		<p>
		<p>It can make a melee attack roll (its ability vs target’s Agility Threshold) against a creature within 5 feet of it, where it is using a melee clone weapon that deals 2/4 blunt damage. You may decide to dismiss this clone (poof it out of existence) anytime as an extra action on or outside of your turn.</p>
