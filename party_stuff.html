<h1 id="buffer">Party and Travel Stuff</h1>

<p> You exist within a party of other playable characters. Collectively, you and your other party members have supplies, renown, and other things which you all share as a party. </p>


<h2>Wagon</h2>

<p> Your party has a wagon, which is a vehicle that your party uses to go from place to place quickly. This is what stores your supply items. This wagon also has its own separate stats and abilities. </p>

<p>Each vehicle has different gas usage per day, so pay attention to that</p>

<h2>Supplies</h2>
<p> Supplies are items that are shared across your party and are stored in the party's wagon. Each wagon has its own benefits, features, and item slots. Certain items such as rations, types of parts, and different types of treasure are stored here.</p>

<h2>Rations and Hunger</h2>
<p>On the road, you need to eat in order to avoid hunger. Hunger is a stat your entire party has, which may affect you in various ways.
</p>
<p>For every travel day, you use up 1 ration, unless you decide not to eat that day. If you don't eat at least 1 ration a day, you acquire 1 Hunger Damage. Hunger Damage does not propogate or be shaken off, and cannot be healed with a skill or ability. You lose all acquired Hunger Damage by eating a ration.</p>


<h2>Dates and Travel Days</h2>
<p>It may go without saying, but every in-game day has its own date. This is particularly important for supply usage, such as using rations and fuel over a certain amount of travel time.</p>



<h2>Renown</h2>
<p>This is how famous your party is, and also what your party is famous for. Your renown will have a number of descriptive tags such as (but not limited to): helpfulness, selflessness, brave, cowardly, greedy, murderous, destructive, etc. Your Renown also has a number, which determines if certain characters have or have not heard of your party.</p>
