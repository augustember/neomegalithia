<h2><strong>Rankless Abilities</strong></h2>


<p>
These abilities have no training rank in order to be gained. Unlike Default Abilities, these are <em>not</em> abilities that all characters have. These must be chosen upon being made to gain new abilities.

        <h3>Lesser Telekinesis</h3>
        <p>Type: Utility</p>
        <p>Energy Cost: 1</p>
        <p>Action Type: Standard, Decisive</p>
        <p>Grants the caster the ability to manipulate and move objects from a distance without physical contact. This spell can target objects that weigh up to 10 pounds within a 30-foot radius. The caster can lift, move, or manipulate the object within the spell's range, such as opening an unlocked door, retrieving an item from a shelf, or subtly moving an object to distract someone. The control is precise enough to perform simple tasks, like pouring a potion or writing a brief message with a pen, but not for more complex manipulations requiring fine motor skills. The effect lasts until Fast Times ends.
