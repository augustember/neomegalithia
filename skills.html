<p>
All playable characters possess the skills listed below. Upon character creation you assign the skills your various Core Bonus types as described in the Character Creation section. 
</p>
<h2>Skill Bonuses and Thresholds</h2>


<p>
All skills have bonuses and thresholds. Bonuses are numbers which add to your roll, whereas thresholds are target numbers which are rolled against by something (a creature, situation, some kind of hazard, etc). These are futher elaborated upon in the Bonuses and Thresholds section. 
</p>
<p>
This threshold is the target number that your skill roll must meet or exceed to succeed in a task. The skill threshold is calculated as <strong>10 + [Core Bonus] + [Gear Bonus] + [Trait Increase]</strong>.
</p>
<h2>Difficulty Rating (DR) Skill Checks</h2>


<p>
To perform a skill check, make a roll and add its assigned Core Bonus. The result is then compared to a Difficulty Rating (DR) set by the GM.
</p>
<h2>Rolling a Skill Against a Creature</h2>


<p>
When using a skill directly against another character or creature, compare your skill roll to the target's relevant threshold or roll. The higher result wins the contest.
</p>
<h2>Skill and Stat Interaction</h2>


<p>
Skills provide a versatile toolkit for characters, influencing combat, exploration, and interaction in meaningful ways. Effective use of skills can turn the tide in challenging situations.
</p>
<h2>Upgrading Skills</h2>


<p>
Sometimes you may be made to upgrade a skill, which just means you may choose a skill that was previously untrained to become a trained one.
