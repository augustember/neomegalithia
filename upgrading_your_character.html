<p>
Like many other RPGs, this uses experience points which grant certain levels upon gaining a certain amount of experience points.
</p>
<h2>Levels and Experience</h2>


<p>
Levels start at 1 and can be a maximum of 12. A particular level grants you specific benefits, such as Core Bonus increases, new traits, Skill Upgrades, Ability Rank Increases, and new abilities. Experience Points are numbers which determine when you gain levels upon meeting a certain threshold. Various encounters reward experience points. 
</p>
<h2>Benefits Upon Leveling Up</h2>


<p>
Every level you gain <strong>+10 HP Maximum</strong> and<strong> +1 Energy Maximum</strong> plus all the stuff contained within the experience chart below.
</p>
<h2>Experience Chart</h2>

What these various things mean are described below the chart.

<h2>Core Bonus Increases</h2>


<p>
Various Core Bonuses increase by +1 at certain levels. The Big Bonus increase by +1 every level, the Medium Bonus increases by +1 every odd level, and the Small Bonus increases by +1 every level which is a multiple of 3.
</p>


<h2>Ability Rank Increases</h2>
<p>
Your Ability Rank applies across all of your gained abilities, and increases at certain levels. For each upgrade for this it goes from whichever one it is to the next, where the ranks go from Novice, Expert, and Master. Whenever you gain a new rank, you may <strong>choose 3 abilities for the rank which was increased</strong>, where you assign your Big, Medium, and Small Bonuses among them of your choosing.
</p>

<h2>Skill Upgrade</h2>
<p>On certain levels you upgrade your skills in the following way:</p>
<li><strong>Select 3 Expertise Skills</strong> that do not currently have any of your Core Bonuses (Big, Medium, Small) assigned to them. Distribute one of each Core Bonus among these skills. This means one Expertise Skill will receive your Big Bonus, another will receive your Medium Bonus, and the third will receive your Small Bonus.
<li><strong>Select 3 Knowledge Skills</strong> that do not currently have any of your Core Bonuses (Big, Medium, Small) assigned to them. Similar to the Expertise Skills, allocate one of each Core Bonus among these Knowledge Skills. This means one Knowledge Skill will receive your Big Bonus, another will receive your Medium Bonus, and the third will receive your Small Bonus.</li>

<p>
Additionally, you get to improve <strong>1 </strong>skill of yours that hasn't yet received a Big Bonus. This means you can upgrade its Core Bonus from none or small to medium, or from medium to big.
</p>


<h2>Standard Actions Increase</h2>
<p>
A standard Actions Increase increases how many standard actions you may use per turn by <strong>+1.</strong>
</p>


<h2>New Traits</h2>
<p>
Traits are passive effects which you always have upon taking one. Every time you are made to take New Traits, you gain <strong>1 of each trait type (Knowledge, Basic, and Powerful)</strong> of your choosing listed in the Traits section.
