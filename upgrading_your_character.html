    <p>Experience required for leveling follows a polynomial growth pattern, with the amount needed increasing as characters reach higher levels.<p>
	
	<h2>Gaining New Abilities</h2>
	
	<h2>Ability Rank Upgrade</h2>
	<p>As a level 1 you have that ability rank of Novice. However, at levels 4 and 8 your ability rank goes up. Your ability rank determines what abilities you may acquire and assign dice to. For each upgrade for this it goes from whichever one it is to the next, where the ranks go from Novice, Expert, and Master. Whenever you gain a new rank, you may choose 3 abilities for the rank which was increased, and you may assign a die to an ability's die slot if it has one.</p>

	<h2>Assigning New Dice</h2>
	<p>Every level you gain an new type of die as seen on the experience chart. If an ability doesn't have any die assigned to it, you may assign one of your core dice to it as long as as you have that ability. If you have already assigned a die to it previously, you may switch out a die with a lower size with a new one if a bigger size and put that die which was replaced in some other skill or ability's die slot of your choosing. You can do the same for skills, except you are considered to have all of the skills.</p>
	
	<h2>New Traits</h2>
	<p>At levels 5 and 9 you gain new traits. Traits are passive effects which you always have upon taking one. Every time you are made to take New Traits, you gain 1 of each trait type (Knowledge, Basic, and Powerful) of your choosing listed in the Traits section.</p>
