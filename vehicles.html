<h1>Vehicles</h1>

<p>Let's be real, you know what a vehicle is. These are machines used to transport people or goods. 

<h3>Vehicle Health and Escape</h3>
Like creatures, vehicles have their own HP. However, they do not have wounds, and when their HP drops to 0, they explode and are destroyed. As they are destroyed, all occupants of that vehicle must make an Agility roll vs the vehicles Escape score. On a success, those occupants successfully escape to an adjacent unoccupied space of that vehicle. Any occupants that failed this Agility roll become targets of the vehicle's explosion. The explosion makes a +5 roll against all of those target's Toughness Threshold, and on a hit the explosion deals 5/10 fire damage.


<h3>Augmented Reality Display</h3>
When occupying a vehicle, you have access to a user interface which has information such as the vehicle's current speed and other statuses.


<h3>Occupancy</h3>
Vehicles can only contain up to a certain amount of 5 Cube Creatures at a time. Once you occupy a vehicle, you move with that vehicle. Most vehicles need only one driver/pilot, but some may require more for various reasons. Every vehicle has a Max Occupancy number, where every number represents 1 5 foot creature.

<h3>Controlling a Vehicle</h3>
A vehicle uses the driver's actions (Standard or Extra Actions) for its movement, attacks, or other actions specific for that vehicle. When occupying or piloting a vehicle, you may still perform abilites. When using a vehicle's skills, the driver may either use her own skill bonuses or thresholds or the vehicle's she is driving. The driver of the vehicle is the one that controls those skills and abilities.

<h3>Enemy Targeting</h3>
Enemies may target either you or the vehicle if you are occupying it, unless the vehicle protects against that.

<h3>Vehicle Stats</h3>
Vehicles have hit points, defense, and traits, skills, and abilities. 

<h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
Most vehicles are equipped with an artificial intelligence (AI) personality. These AIs assist the drivers and occupants in various ways.

<h3>Ramming with a Vehicle</h3>
Vehicles can run over creatures, other vehicles, and various other targets when they move into them. When you would ram a target, make  If that target is the same size or above, this ramming vehicle must stop right before the target. If the target is smaller than this ramming vehicle, the vehicle can move past the target it is ramming. The target being rammed takes its ramming damage.
